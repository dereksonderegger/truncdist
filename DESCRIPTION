Description: A collection of tools to evaluate probability density
        functions, cumulative distribution functions, quantile functions
        and random numbers for truncated random variables.  These functions are
        provided to also compute the expected value and variance. Nadarajah
        and Kotz (2006) developed most of the functions. QQ plots can be produced.
        All the probability functions in the stats, stats4 and evd
        packages are automatically available for truncation. 
        This package is an extension of the truncdist package, but modified to be 
        more robust and appropriate handle 	distributions that have parameters n, p, q, or x.
